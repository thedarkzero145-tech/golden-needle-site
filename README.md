# 🧵 Digital Atelier: Precision in Chaos
A high-end sewing and garment business site concept built with **Vite + TailwindCSS + JavaScript**.

## 🚀 The Concept
The site mimics the chaotic yet structured nature of a tailor's workshop. 
- **Anti-Gravity UI**: Business categories are physical entities that react to user interaction.
- **The "Stitch" Mechanic**: Users can "grab" services (Bespoke, Repair) to reveal details, simulating the tactile feel of picking up fabric.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast frontend tooling.
- **Matter.js**: 2D rigid body physics for the "shatter and float" effect.
- **Node.js**: Environment management.

## 🎨 Design Language
- **Palette**: Forest Green, Gold, Silk Cream.
- **Philosophy**: "Precision in Chaos."
